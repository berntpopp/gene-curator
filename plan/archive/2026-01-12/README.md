# Archived Documents - 2026-01-12

## Reason for Archival

These documents were archived as part of the planning consolidation for the `feature/scope-centric-refactor` branch. They have been superseded by the [Curations Implementation Plan v2.1](../../CURATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v2.1.md).

## Archived Files

| File | Original Location | Reason |
|------|-------------------|--------|
| `ACTION_PLAN.md` | `enhancements/tracking/` | Superseded by curations plan and updated enhancement status |
| `APPROVED_ENHANCEMENTS.md` | `enhancements/tracking/` | Information consolidated into main enhancements README |

## Current Active Documents

For the current state of planning, see:

- **[Main Plan README](../../README.md)** - Entry point for all planning
- **[Curations Implementation Plan v2.1](../../CURATIONS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN_v2.1.md)** - Current critical blocker
- **[Enhancements README](../../enhancements/README.md)** - Enhancement tracking with updated status

## Historical Context

These documents were created during the initial enhancement analysis phase comparing Gene Curator with kidney-genetics-db patterns. The core insights have been preserved in the enhancement proposals, but the action plan documents are now obsolete as:

1. The curations endpoint became the critical blocker
2. Enhancement priorities shifted based on actual implementation needs
3. The implementation order is now clear from the updated status tables
